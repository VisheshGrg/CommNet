This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) and server on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)

# Description
This project is a real-time WebSocket chat application built with Next.js and Node.js. It allows users to engage in live chat conversations, leveraging the power of WebSockets for instant messaging. The frontend is developed with Next.js, providing a fast and responsive user interface, while the backend is powered by Node.js to handle the WebSocket
## Getting Started

### First, run the development client:

1. `npm install` - install packages

```bash
2. npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

### Run the NodeJs Server:

`npm install` - install packages

```bash
npm run dev
```
